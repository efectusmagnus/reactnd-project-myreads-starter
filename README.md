# MyReads - Project NÂ°7

This project was built for the Udacity Front-End Web Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:
* clone this repository in Git Bash with `git clone https://github.com/efectusmagnus/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

Once all dependencies have been installed, you can launch the app with:
* `npm start`

A new browser window should automatically open the browser and display the app.
If it does not happen, navigate to http:localhost:3000/ in your browser of choice.

## How to use the App

* Books are sorted in three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Already Read.

* To change a book's category or remove a book from the book store, click on the blue button besides the cover.
* To add new books, click on the brown + button to open the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
